# Dog Breed Classifier
In this Project, Firstly, I implemented Convolutional Neural Network to classify dog breeds using Transfer Learning. Transfer learning in which we are using pretrained networks like VGG-16,Resnet, Inception, Xception and many more. 

#### Goal
- To classify the breeds of dogs

#### Dependencies
* numpy
* pandas
* keras
* glob
* matplotlib
* cv2
* sklearn
* tqdm
* PIL

I used jupyter notebook for the implementation
